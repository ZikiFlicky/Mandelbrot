# An illustration of the mandelbrot set written in Python
This is a small illustration of the mandelbrot set I wrote
to understand the idea behind it.

This illustration is not optimized and slow, and is just for learning purposes.

## Running
This was only tested on Python 3.8 with pygame 2 but may work on lower versions.

When running the you will see the illustration. You can zoom in and out with the mouse
wheel and move around with the left mouse button.
